# Nginx-file-browser-improvement
Visual improvement for Nginx on file browser or autoindex mode to make it a bit prettier than the original version.

To use, on the Nginx server configuration, set `add_before_body` and `add_after_body` to the before and after HTMLs.

Order of pictures: UI v3.1, v3, v2, v1+ (v1 enhanced) and v1.

**Note:** UI v4 is visually equal to UI v3.1, but it has support for portrait mode.

<img src="Pictures/UI v3.1.png" width="500"><img src="Pictures/UI v3.png" width="500"><img src="Pictures/UI v2.png" width="500"><img src="Pictures/UI v1+.png" width="500"><img src="Pictures/UI v1.png" width="500">

Feel free to do whatever you'd like with this.
